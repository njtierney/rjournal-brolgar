  <title>brolgar: An R package to BRowse Over Longitudinal Data Graphically and Analytically in R</title>

  <meta property="description" itemprop="description" content="Longitudinal (panel) data provide the opportunity to examine temporal patterns of individuals, because measurements are collected on the same person at different, and often irregular, time points. The data is typically visualised using a &quot;spaghetti plot&quot;, where a line plot is drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects, these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. The interesting aspects of individual differences are lost in the noise. Longitudinal data is often modelled with a hierarchical linear model to capture the overall trends, and variation among individuals, while accounting for various levels of dependence. However, these models can be difficult to fit, and can miss unusual individual patterns. Better visual tools can help to diagnose longitudinal models, and better capture the individual experiences. This paper introduces the R package, brolgar (BRowse over Longitudinal data Graphically and Analytically in R), which provides tools to identify and summarise interesting individual patterns in longitudinal data."/>

{"title":"brolgar: An R package to BRowse Over Longitudinal Data Graphically and Analytically in R","description":"Longitudinal (panel) data provide the opportunity to examine temporal patterns of individuals, because measurements are collected on the same person at different, and often irregular, time points. The data is typically visualised using a \"spaghetti plot\", where a line plot is drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects, these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. The interesting aspects of individual differences are lost in the noise.

<p><p>Longitudinal (panel) data provide the opportunity to examine
temporal patterns of individuals, because measurements are collected on
the same person at different, and often irregular, time points. The data
is typically visualised using a “spaghetti plot”, where a line plot is
drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the
appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects,
these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. The interesting
aspects of individual differences are lost in the noise. Longitudinal
data is often modelled with a hierarchical linear model to capture the
overall trends, and variation among individuals, while accounting for
various levels of dependence. However, these models can be difficult to
fit, and can miss unusual individual patterns. Better visual tools can
help to diagnose longitudinal models, and better capture the individual
experiences. This paper introduces the R package, brolgar (BRowse over
Longitudinal data Graphically and Analytically in R), which provides
tools to identify and summarise interesting individual patterns in
longitudinal data.</p></p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This paper is about exploring longitudinal data effectively. By
“longitudinal data” we specifically mean individuals repeatedly measured
through time. This could include panel data, where possibly different
samples from a key variable (e.g. country), are aggregated at each time
collection. The important component is a key variable with repeated
measurements regularly, or irregularly over time. The inherent structure
allows us to examine temporal patterns of individuals, shown in Figure
<a href="#fig:heights-sample-plot">1</a>, of the average height of Australian males
over years. The individual component is <code>country</code>, and the
time component is <code>year</code>. The variable <code>country</code>
along with other variables is measured repeatedly from 1900 to 1970,
with irregular intervals between years.</p>

<p>The full dataset of Figure <a href="#fig:heights-sample-plot">1</a> is shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:spaghetti">2</a>, showing 144 countries from the year 1700.
This plot is challenging to understand because there is overplotting,
making it hard to see the individuals. Solutions to this are not always
obvious. Showing separate individual plots of each country does not
help, as 144 plots is too many to comprehend. Making the lines
transparent or fitting a simple model to all the data Figure
<a href="#fig:spaghetti">2</a>B, might be a common first step to see common trends.
However, all this seems to clarify is: 1) There is a set of some
countries that are similar, and they are distributed around the center
of the countries, and 2) there is a general upward trend in heights over
time. We learn about the collective, but lose sight of the
individuals.</p>

<p>This paper demonstrates how to effectively and efficiently explore
longitudinal data, using the R package, <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a>. We
examine four problems in exploring longitudinal data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to sample the data</li>
<li>Finding interesting individuals</li>
<li>Finding representative individuals</li>
<li>Understanding a model</li>
</ol>
<p>This paper proceeds in the following way: first, a brief review of
existing approaches to longitudinal data, then the definition of
longitudinal data, then approaches to these four problems are discussed,
followed by a summary.</p>
<h1 id="other-approaches">Background</h1>
<p>R provides basic time series, <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ts">ts</a>, objects, which are
vectors or matrices that represent data sampled at equally spaced points
in time. These have been extended through packages such as <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=xts">xts</a>, and <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoo">zoo</a> <span
class="citation" data-cites="xts zoo">(<a href="#ref-zoo"
role="doc-biblioref">Zeileis and Grothendieck 2005</a>; <a
href="#ref-xts" role="doc-biblioref">Ryan and Ulrich 2020</a>)</span>,
which only consider data in a wide format with a regular implied time
series. These are not appropriate for longitudinal data, which can have
indexes that are not time unit oriented, such as “Wave 1…n”, or may
contain irregular intervals.</p>
<p>Other packages focus more directly on panel data in R, focussing on
data operations and model interfaces. The <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pmdplyr">pmdplyr</a> package
provides “Panel Manoeuvres” in <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr">dplyr</a><span
class="citation" data-cites="pmdplyr">(<a href="#ref-pmdplyr"
role="doc-biblioref">Huntington-Klein and Khor 2020</a>)</span>. It
defines the data structure in as a <code>pibble</code> object
(<strong>p</strong>anel t<strong>ibble</strong>), requiring an
<code>id</code> and <code>group</code> column being defined to identify
the unique identifier and grouping. The <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pmdplyr">pmdplyr</a> package
focuses on efficient and custom joins and functions, such as
<code>inexact_left_join()</code>. It does not implement tidyverse
equivalent tools, but instead extends their usecase with a new function,
for example <code>mutate_cascade</code> and <code>mutate_subset</code>.
The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=panelr">panelr</a>
package provides an interface for data reshaping on panel data,
providing widening and lengthening functions (<code>widen_panel()</code>
and <code>long_panel()</code> <span class="citation"
data-cites="panelr">(<a href="#ref-panelr" role="doc-biblioref">Long
2020</a>)</span>). It also provides model facilitating functions by
providing its own interface for mixed effects models. The <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=plm">plm</a> package <span
class="citation" data-cites="plm">(<a href="#ref-plm"
role="doc-biblioref">Millo 2017</a>)</span> for panel data econometrics
provides methods for estimating models such as GMM for panel data, and
testing, for example for model specification or serial correlation. It
also provides a data structure, the <code>pdata.frame</code>, which
stores the index attribute of the individual and time dimensions, for
use within the package’s functions.</p>
<p>These software generally re-implement their own custom panel data
class object, as well as custom data cleaning tasks, such as reshaping
into long and wide form. They all share similar features, providing some
identifying or index variable, and some grouping or key.</p>
<h1 id="data">Longitudinal Data Structures</h1>
<p>Longitudinal data is a sibling of many other temporal data forms,
including panel data, repeated measures, and time series. The
differences are many, and can be in data collection, context and even
the field of research. Time series are usually long and regularly spaced
in time. Panel data may measure different units at each time point and
aggregate these values by a categorical or key variable. Repeated
measures typically measure before and after treatment effects. We like
to think of longitudinal as measuring the same individual (e.g. wage
earner) over time, but this definition is not universally agreed on.
Despite the differences, they all share a fundamental similarity: they
are measurements over a time period.</p>
<p>This time period has structure - the time component (dates, times,
waves, seconds, etc), and the spacing between measurements - unequal or
equal. This data structure needs to be respected during analysis to
preserve the lowest level of granularity, to avoid for example,
collapsing across month when the data is collected every second, or
assuming measurements occur at fixed time intervals. These mistakes can
be avoided by encoding the data structure into the data itself. This
information can then be accessed by analysis tools, providing a
consistent way to understand and summarise the data. This ensures the
different types of longitudinal data previously mentioned can be handled
in the same way.</p>
<h2 id="building-on-tsibble">Building on a tsibble</h2>
<p>Since longitudinal data can be thought of as “individuals repeatedly
measured through time”, they can be considered as a type of time series,
as defined in <span class="citation" data-cites="fpp">Hyndman and
Athanasopoulos (<a href="#ref-fpp"
role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>: “Anything that is observed
sequentially over time <strong>is a time series</strong>”. This
definition has been realised as a time series <code>tsibble</code> in
<span class="citation" data-cites="Wang2020">(<a href="#ref-Wang2020"
role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2020</a>)</span>. These objects are
defined as data meeting these conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <code>index</code>: the time variable</li>
<li>The <code>key</code>: variable(s) defining individual groups (or
series)</li>
<li>The <code>index</code> and <code>key</code> (1 + 2) together
determine a distinct row</li>
</ol>
<p>If the specified key and index pair do not define a distinct row -
for example, if there are duplicates in the data, the
<code>tsibble</code> will not be created. This helps ensure the data is
properly understood and cleaned before analysis is conducted, removing
avoidable errors that might have impacted downstream decisions.</p>
<p>We can formally define our <code>heights</code> data from Figure
<a href="#fig:heights-sample-plot">1</a> as a <code>tsibble</code> using,
<code>as_tsibble</code>:</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class='va'>heights_brolgar</span> <span class='op'>&lt;-</span> <span class='fu'>as_tsibble</span><span class='op'>(</span><span class='va'>heights_brolgar</span>,
                      index <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='va'>year</span>,
                      key <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='va'>country</span>,
                      regular <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='cn'>FALSE</span><span class='op'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <code>index</code> is <code>year</code>, the <code>key</code> is
<code>country</code>, and <code>regular = FALSE</code> since the
intervals in the years measured are not regular. Using a
<code>tsibble</code> means that the index and key time series
information is recorded only <strong>once</strong>, and can be referred
to many times in other parts of the data analysis by time-aware
tools.</p>
<p>In addition to providing consistent ways to manipulate time series
data, further benefits to building on <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a> are how it
works within the <code>tidyverse</code> ecosystem, as well as the tidy
time series packages called “tidyver<strong>ts</strong>”, containing <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=fable">fable</a> <span
class="citation" data-cites="fable">(<a href="#ref-fable"
role="doc-biblioref">O’Hara-Wild et al. 2020a</a>)</span>, <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts">feasts</a>, <span
class="citation" data-cites="feasts">(<a href="#ref-feasts"
role="doc-biblioref">O’Hara-Wild et al. 2020b</a>)</span>. For example,
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a>
provides modified <code>tidyverse</code> functions to explore implicit
missing values in the <code>index</code> (e.g., <code>has_gaps()</code>
and <code>fill_gaps()</code>), as well as grouping and partitioning
based on the index with <code>index_by()</code>. For full details and
examples of use with the tidyverts time series packages, see <span
class="citation" data-cites="Wang2020">Wang et al. (<a
href="#ref-Wang2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a>
package uses <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a> so users
can take advantage of these tools, learning one way of operating a data
analysis that will work and have overlap with other contexts.</p>
<h2 id="characterising-individual-series">Characterising Individual
Series</h2>
<h3 id="calculating-a-feature">Calculating a Feature</h3>
<p>We can summarise the individual series by collapsing their many
measurements into a single statistic, such as the minimum, maximum, or
median, with one row per key. We do this with the <code>features</code>
function from the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=fabletools">fabletools</a>
package, made available in <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a>. This
provides a summary of a given variable, accounting for the time series
structure, and returning one row per key specified. It can be thought of
as a time-series aware variant of the <code>summarise</code> function
from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr">dplyr</a>. The
<code>feature</code> function works by specifying the data, the variable
to summarise, and the feature to calculate. A template is shown
below</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">features</span>(<span class="sc">&lt;</span>DATA<span class="sc">&gt;</span>, <span class="sc">&lt;</span>VARIABLE<span class="sc">&gt;</span>, <span class="sc">&lt;</span>FEATURE<span class="sc">&gt;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>For example, to calculate the minimum height for each key (country),
in <code>heights</code>, we specify the <code>heights</code> data, then
the variable to calculate features on, <code>height_cm</code>, then the
feature to calculate, <code>min</code> (we write
<code>c(min = min)</code> so the column calculated gets the name
“min”):</p>

<p>This takes the <code>heights</code> data, pipes it to
<code>features</code>, and then instructs it to summarise the
<code>height_cm</code> variable, using <code>feat_five_num</code>. There
are several handy functions for calculating features of the data that
<code>brolgar</code> provides. These all start with <code>feat_</code>,
and include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>feat_ranges()</code>: min, max, range difference,
interquartile range;</li>
<li><code>feat_spread()</code>: variance, standard deviation, median
absolute distance, and interquartile range;</li>
<li><code>feat_monotonic()</code>: is it always increasing, decreasing,
or unvarying?;</li>
<li><code>feat_diff_summary()</code>: the summary statistics of the
differences amongst a value, including the five number summary, as well
as the standard deviation and variance;</li>
<li><code>feat_brolgar()</code>, which will calculate all features
available in the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a>
package.</li>
<li>Other examples of features from the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts">feasts</a>

</ul>
<h3 id="feature-sets">Feature Sets</h3>
<p>If you want to run many or all features from a package on your data
you can collect them all with <code>feature_set</code>. For example:</p>

particularly useful is that these will work on any type of time series
data, and you can use other more typical time series features from the

However, we cannot process and understand the individuals when the data
is presented like this.</p>
<h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2>
<p>Just how spaghetti is portioned out for consumption, we can sample
some of the data by randomly sampling the data into sub-plots with the
<code>facet_sample()</code> function (Figure

<p>We have not lost any of the data, only the order in which they are
presented has changed. We learn the distribution and changes in heights
over time, and those measured from the earliest times appear to be more
similar, but there is much wider variation in the middle years, and then
for more recent heights measured from the early 1900s, the heights are
more similar. The starting point of each of these years seems to
increase at roughly the same interval. This informs us that the starting
times of the years is approximately uniform.</p>
<p>Together <code>facet_sample()</code> and <code>facet_strata()</code>
allow for rapid exploration, by focusing on relevant questions instead
of the minutiae. This is achieved by appropriately randomly assigning
while maintaining key structure, keeping the correct number of keys per
plot, and so on. For example, <code>facet_sample()</code> the questions
are: “How many lines per facet” and “How many facets?”, and for
<code>facet_strata()</code> the questions are: “How many facets /
strata?” and “What to arrange plots along?”.</p>
<p>Answering these questions keeps the analysis in line with the
analytic goals of exploring the data, rather than distracting to
minutiae. This is a key theme of improving tools for data analysis.
Abstracting away the parts that are not needed, so the analyst can focus
on the task at hand.</p>
<p>Under the hood, <code>facet_sample()</code> and
<code>facet_strata()</code> are powered with
<code>sample_n_keys()</code> and <code>stratify_keys()</code>. These can
be used to create data structures used in <code>facet_sample()</code>
and <code>facet_strata()</code>, and extend them for other purposes.</p>
<p>Using a <code>tsibble</code> stores important key and index
components, in turn allowing for better ways to break up spaghetti plots
so we can look at many and all sub-samples using
<code>facet_sample()</code> and <code>facet_strata()</code>.</p>
<h1 id="book-keeping">Book-keeping</h1>
<p>Longitudinal data is not always measured at the same time and at the
same frequency. When exploring longitudinal data, a useful first step is
to explore the frequency of measurements of the index. We can check if
the index is regular using <code>index_regular()</code> and summarise
the spacing of the index with <code>index_summary()</code>. These are S3
methods, so for <code>data.frame</code> objects, the <code>index</code>
must be specified, however for the <code>tsibble</code> objects, the
defined index is used.</p>

say anything about those individuals with few measurements. The data
used, <code>heights_brolgar</code> has less than 5 measurements. This
was done using <code>add_n_obs()</code>, which adds the number of

<p>Looking at a spaghetti plot, it can be hard to identify which lines
are the most interesting, or unusual. A workflow to identify interesting
individuals to start with is given below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Decide upon an interesting feature (e.g., maximum)</li>
<li>This feature produces one value per key</li>
<li>Examine the distribution of the feature</li>
<li>Join this table back to the data to get all observations for those
keys</li>
<li>Arrange the keys or filter, using the feature</li>
<li>Display the data for selected keys</li>
</ol>
<p>This workflow is now demonstrated. Firstly, we <strong>deicde on an
interesting feature</strong>, “maximum height”, and whether height is
always increasing. We calculate our own “feature”, calculating maximum
height, and whether a value is increasing (with brolgar’s
<code>increasing</code> function) as follows:</p>

<p>This fits height in centimetres with a smooth effect for year for
each country, with a different intercept for each country. It is roughly
equivalent to a random intercept varying slope model. Note that this gam
model took approximately 8074 seconds to fit. We add the predicted and
residual values for the model below, as well as the residual sums of
squares for each country.</p>

<p>We can use the previous approach to explore the model results. We can
take a look at a sample of the predictions along with the data, by using
<code>sample_n_keys</code>. This provides a useful way to explore some
set of the model predictions. In order to find those predictions that
best summarise the best, and worst, and in between, we need to use the
methods in the next section, “stereotyping”.</p>

<h1 id="steretyping">Stereotyping</h1>
<p>To help understand a population of measurements over time, it can be
useful to understand which individual measurements are typical (or
“stereotypical”) of a measurement. For example, to understand which
individuals are stereotypical of a statistic such as the minimum,
median, and maximum height. This section discusses how to find these
stereotypes in the data.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:heights-aug-res-summary">12</a> shows the residuals of the
simple model fit to the data in the previous section. There is an
overlaid five number summary, showing the minimum, 1st quantile, median,
3rd quantile, and maximum residual value residuals, as well as a rug
plot to show the data. We can use these residuals to understand the
stereotypes of the data - those individuals in the model that best match
to this five number summary.</p>

<p>We can do this using <code>keys_near()</code> from
<code>brolgar</code>. By default this uses the 5 number summary, but any
function can be used. You specify the variable you want to find the keys
nearest, in this case <code>rss</code>, residual sums of squares for
each key:</p>

Moldova fits a nearly perfectly straight line, and the maximum residuals
for Myanmar have wide spread of values.</p>

<p>The functions are all designed to build upon existing packages, but
are predicated on working with <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a>. The
package extends upon <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2">ggplot2</a> to provide
facets for exploration: <code>facet_sample()</code> and
<code>facet_strata()</code>. Extending <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr">dplyr</a>’s
<code>sample_n()</code> and <code>sample_frac()</code> functions by
providing sampling and stratifying based around keys:
<code>sample_n_keys()</code>, <code>sample_frac_keys()</code>, and
<code>stratify_keys()</code>. New functions are focussed around the use
of <code>key</code>, for example <code>key_slope()</code> to find the
slope of each key, and <code>keys_near()</code> to find those keys near
a summary statistic. Finally, feature calculation is provided by
building upon the existing time series feature package, <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts">feasts</a>.</p>
<p>To get started with <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> you must
first ensure your data is specified as a <code>tsibble</code> -
discussed earlier in the paper, there is also a vignette <a
href="http://brolgar.njtierney.com/articles/longitudinal-data-structures.html">“Longitudinal
Data Structures”</a>, which discusses these ideas. The next step we
recommend is sampling some of your data with
<code>facet_sample()</code>, and <code>facet_strata()</code>. When using
<code>facet_strata()</code>, facets can be arranged in order of a
variable, using the <code>along</code> argument, which can reveal
interesting features.</p>
<p>To further explore longitudinal data, we recommend finding summary
features of each variable with <code>features</code>, and identifying
variables that are near summary statistics, using <code>keys_near</code>
to find individuals stereotypical of a statistical value.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Concluding Remarks</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a>
package facilitates exploring longitudinal data in R. It builds upon
existing infrastructure from <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a>, and <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts">feasts</a>, which work
within the <code>tidyverse</code> family of R packages, as well as the
newer, <code>tidyverts</code>, time series packages. Users familiar with
either of these package families will find a lot of similarity in their
use, and first time users will be able to easily transition from <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> to the
<code>tidyverse</code> or <code>tidyverts</code>.</p>
<p>Visualizing categorical or binary data over a time period can be
difficult as the limited number of values on the y axis leads to
overplotting. This can conceal the number of values present at a given
value. The tools discussed in <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> facilitate
this in the form of <code>facet_sample</code>, and
<code>facet_strata</code>. Some special methods could be developed to
add jitter or noise around these values on the y axis, while still
maintaining the graphical axis and tick marks.</p>
<p>Future work will explore more features and stratifications, and
stereotypes, and generalise the tools to work for data without time
components, and other data types.</p>
